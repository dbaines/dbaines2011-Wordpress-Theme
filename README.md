dbaines2011 - dBaines.com Wordpress Theme
==========================================

This was the theme currently in use at dBaines.com during 2011.
Development of this project has now ceased. Any future updates will be to the [dbaines2012-Wordpress-Theme project](https://github.com/dbaines/dbaines2012-Wordpress-Theme), still available here at Github.

## Notable features:

* Custom Post types for artwork, motion and website portfolios
* Motion Post Type uses flowplayer to display a .flv video
* Website Post Type uses easySlider to display multiple images of each website project
* Search bar drop down options to search in specific custom post types, or all
* Permalinks for custom post type indexes
* RSS Feeds for custom post types
* Portfolio page takes the latest thumbnail from each area (website, artwork, motion) and creates a button from that image
* Modified SudoSlider script to include keyboard navigation and support for multiple easysliders on a single page
* Heavy uses of HTML5 and CSS3
* Custom homepage theme
* Randomised 404 page
* Responsive design for less than 960 width and a mobile-friendly(ish) display for less than 600.
* Custom login page
* Shortcodes reference panel when writing a post
* Theme Options page:
	* Enable Google +1 buttons
	* Enable the count bubble for the Google +1 buttons

	* Use custom Wordpress blogroll links category instead of hardcoded friends list
	* Custom Footer text
	* Custom Comments intro text
	* Custom Google Analytics code
	
It should be noted that this theme does not (and will not) support old browsers. 

## Recommended Wordpress Plugins:

* Additional Image Sizes - Provides image sizes for homepage slider, website slider, gallery thumbnail, as well as the default post sizes.
* Advanced Excerpt - HTMLified Excerpts for searches and tutorial posts
* Custom Field Template - Very handy template to set up custom fields for different custom post types. 
* Post Types Order - Quickly and easily re-arrange your custom post types - in my case portfolio entries.

## Version History

### 1.7 - 2012-01-17
* FINAL VERSION - Superceded by [the 2012 theme](https://github.com/dbaines/dbaines2012-Wordpress-Theme).
* Re-arranged and styled the author info box at the bottom of loop-single.php, shows up when user has filled out their profile
* Styled Author Archives page
* Multiple Size Favicon (64, 32, 16)
* Added a little "sticky" icon/flag for sticky posts
* Switched from EasySlider to SudoSlider
* Removed left over Google Prettify code

### 1.6 - 2011-08-22
* Fixed the excessive PRE tags in Geshi causing massive padding everywhere. (This was actually part of the last update, I just forgot to document it)
* Minified the customised EasySlider script in plugins.js
* Fixed accesskey 2 for about link
* Updated [download] shortcode to open in new window, removed "Download" part of title text so you can use it as a pretty link button instead.
* Added "or" between load more button and show pagination
* Added some logic to show a disabled load more button if there are no more posts to load
* Added an error message if the loadMore button fails to load the next page
* Adapted post-icons to allow for multiple icons using some jQuery (dbaines.js)

### 1.5 - 2011-08-21
* Removed changelog from style.css for older releases. Still available at GitHub and the URL at the top of the file
* Updated to Modernizr 2.0.6 Custom
* Removed border-top for active menu item when using wordpress menus, since custom post types were showing the blog as being active, rather than the correct parent page. Bug in Wordpress?
* Added custom close button for colorbox
* Added a blue hover state to the homepage logo link
* Implemented Google Code Prettify to replace GeSHi, but changed back due to quirks of Prettify (namely line number incrementing, copy and paste issues and other things GeSHi does better) - I've left the code in /functions/functions.shortcodes.prettify.php
* As a result of the above I've moved the GeSHi stuff in to functions/functions.shortcodes.geshi.php
* Added "Show Pagination" link to the load more posts button. Hides Load More Posts button and shows wp-pagenavi links. LoadMoreButton also pulls in the wp-pagenavi from each page so if the user loads a few pages and then shows the pagination, it shows the relevant page as being current.
* Fixes to the Load More feature:
	* Functionisedâ„¢ the part of the dbaines.js file that adds colorbox classes to everything so we can call it after the new page has been loaded
	* Called gapi.plusone.go after a successful load so the google plus buttons are rendered.
	* Rejiggered the ajax call for the loadMore link to only do one .load() and then cherrypick the things to go places
* Added some accesskeys:
	* 0: Takes the user to the new accessibility page
	* 1: Homepage
	* 2: About
	* 3: Blog
	* 4: Portfolio
	* 5: Search
	* 6: Sitemap
	* 9: Contact Page
	* S: Skip to Content
	
### 1.4 - 2011-08-04
* Styled figcaption for codebox
* Added aprilfools.css for headache inducing fun come April-time
* Added Wordpress Option: Google Analytics UA Code
* Added Wordpress Option: Enable Wordpress Menu - Uses a Wordpress menu, "Main Menu" as the main navigation instead of the hardcoded links
* Added Wordpress Option: Replace 'friends' with 'blogroll' links
* Added Wordpress Option: All posts have thumbnails - includes shiny new generic post-thumbnail.png
* Added Wordpress Option: AJAX Post Loading - Facebook/twitter esque post loading technique
* Removed -webkit-appearance from search input
* Added Google +1 buttons to search results
* Added .2 seconds of transitions (of various vendors) to the top-level nav links for fun and profit
* Gave .homepageSlider h2 1px of text shadow blur to fix the shadow being white in chrome 12/13.
* Added line-height: 1.5 to p,ul - if it affects too many things I'll specify it to content areas only.
* Hardware Acceleration (via the "Magic Bullet" -webkit-transform: translateZ(0);) given to homepage slider and websites slider
* Added a "Shortcodes Reference" box in the new post admin page. Super convenient!
